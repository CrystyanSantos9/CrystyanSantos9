### Hi there 👋

My name is Crystyan Santos i'm from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been studying web developr and other tecnologies tools for about 3 yaers to improve my programation skills. I love programing and tecnologies and more, i really like to learn about the things works and how we can make our lives more productive with tecnologie. I’m currently working on [Allied Brasil](https://www.alliedbrasil.com.br/) as TI System Analyst and and always studying to reach my dream of be an awesome programer in the near future. 

In my free time I like to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and  drink a cold beer with my friends (🍺).
